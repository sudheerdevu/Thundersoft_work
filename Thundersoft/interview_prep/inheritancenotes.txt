in inheritance we have three access specifiers:
1.public
2.private
3.protected
most important access specifiers is public and protected 

	•	Public members are accessible in the derived class and also outside the class via derived class objects.
	•	Protected members are accessible in the derived class but not outside via derived class objects.
	•	Private members of the base class are not accessible in the derived class or outside.

    •	Public members of the base class become protected in the derived class and are not accessible outside it.
	•	Protected members of the base class remain protected.
	•	Private members are still inaccessible.

    •	Public members of the base class become private in the derived class.
	•	Protected members of the base class also become private.
	•	Private members remain inaccessible.


If you want to access protected or private members outside the class, 
you’ll need to use public member functions to provide controlled access or friend classes and friend functions.

Let’s look at how to use friend functions and friend classes in inheritance. 
Friend functions and friend classes allow you to access private and protected members of a class, 
even if they wouldn’t typically be accessible due to the inheritance access specifiers.
