Inheritance:
upon an object we can access the protected and private members but only public.
upon derived class- extends base class
it can access public, protected but not private
its available but cannot accessable
---------
why??
            private     protected       public

inside class    y          y               y

inside derived class
                n           y                y
on Object 
                n            y                y


So you can see that this type of minor details are available in C++.

You can restrict the access down the hierarchy of classes, right?

This is not available in other languages.

It's there in C++ like it's not there in Java.

You cannot inherit publicly.

Privately, there's only one type of inheritance in Java.

So that's it.


when the derived class accessing variables as publicly
then all members are accessible except private
 
further child class - only private cant access
