/*
        Explanation of the Example

	1.	Base Class A: Defines a method show().
	2.	Derived Classes B and C: Both inherit from A using virtual inheritance, which prevents multiple instances of A.
	3.	Derived Class D: Inherits from both B and C. The show() method in D is called to demonstrate its functionality.
	4.	Accessing Base Class Aâ€™s Method: By explicitly specifying obj.A::show(), you can call the base class method without ambiguity.
