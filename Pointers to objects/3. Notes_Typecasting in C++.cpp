/*

Typecasting is converting a variable from one type to another. C++ supports several typecasting methods, including:

	•	static_cast: For safe conversions.
	•	dynamic_cast: For safe downcasting in class hierarchies (only for polymorphic types).
	•	const_cast: To add or remove const qualifiers.
	•	reinterpret_cast: For low-level casts.
