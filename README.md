About Me ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate Python Full Stack Developer and B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student with a growing focus on Data Science, Machine Learning, and Embedded Systems. Currently, Iâ€™m diving deep into C++ for custom delegate development on TensorFlow Lite as part of a project for AMD, gaining hands-on experience with performance optimization and hardware acceleration.

Technical Skills:

	â€¢	Full Stack Development: Proficient in Python, Django, SQL, NoSQL, RESTful APIs, JavaScript, and React.js.
	â€¢	Machine Learning and Data Science: Experience with Python-based ML tools, now expanding into TensorFlow Lite and exploring C++ for embedded systems.
	â€¢	Software Development: Skilled in version control (Git/GitHub), Agile methodologies, and deployment tools like Docker.

Current Goals:

	â€¢	Master C++ and system-level programming for real-time, high-performance applications.
	â€¢	Gain expertise in Machine Learning and Embedded AI, particularly for projects that blend Android development and hardware acceleration.

Personal Mission:
Iâ€™m focused on becoming a versatile engineer with a balance of technical depth in software and strategic understanding of finance. Long-term, I aim to leverage my dual interests in tech and finance to contribute to impactful projects in the tech-finance intersection.
