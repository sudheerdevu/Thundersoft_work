TOPICS TO BE COVERED BY KALYANI MAM:

Beginning with C++,  Data abstraction=call by ref & value / new - delete /inline fns / scope resolution / default args 

Classes and Objects = access specifiers/defining mem fns / nesting member fns / private mem fns / allocating mem for objs / static data members / static member fns / array of obj / objects as fn arguments 

Constructor -Destructor= different constructors / destructors / public + private / Singleton class understanding

inheritance= Check programming Diamond problem and inheritance programs 

Polymorphism = runtime -compile time Polymorphism, fn and operator overloading/ Virtual fns 

Pointers to obj = abstract class , typecasting in C++ , this pointer
